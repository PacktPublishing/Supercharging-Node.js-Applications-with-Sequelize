## Instructions and Navigations

The code will look like the following:
```
Code in text: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file
extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: Mount
the downloaded WebStorm-10*.dmg disk image file as another disk in your system.

A block of code is set as follows:
models.sequelize.sync({
force: true,
logging: false
})

When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items
are set in bold:
// INT(4)
var unsignedInteger = DataTypes.NUMBER({
length: 4,
zerofill: false,
unsigned: true,
});

Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install mysql-server
Bold: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words
in menus or dialog boxes appear in bold. Here is an example: We will want to select the Developer
Default and Install all products options.
```
